<h4>MenuOption props</h4>\n            <p>@name                                必传，[String, Number]，当前组件的唯一标识，默认--</p>\n            <p>@disabled                            非必传，Boolean，disabled，默认false</p>\n            <p>@thumbnail-con                       非必传，String，默认缩略图icon，默认'more'</p>\n            <p style=\"color: red;\">\n                注意：在`thumbnail`为true的时候，需要有缩略图icon，\n                所以`MenuSub`的title和`MenuOptions`，的子内容中需要有一个缩略图Icon，默认`thumbnail-con`，\n                可以自定义，在slot内的元素上加`thumbnail-icon`属性，组件就会将此元素设为缩略图icon，如：\n                &lt;Icon iconname=\"home\" thumbnail-icon/&gt;\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n    data () {\n        return {\n            mode:
