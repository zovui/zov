             <br>v-model接收的值为date类型，date格式应该遵循js原生格式，也就是说能被 Date 对象验证通过的字符串。\n                <br>例如：\n                <br>new Date('2019.12.11')\n                <br>new Date('2019/12/11')\n                <br>new Date('2019-12-11')\n                <br>因此组件接受默认值得数据格式应该如下：\n                <br>'2019-11'\n                <br>'2019'\n                <br>'19'\n                <br>'2019-2-03'\n

<br>例如\n                <br>YYYY年MM月DD日，2019年12月20日\n                <br>YYYY=MM=DD，2019=12=20\n                <br>开发者也可以通过on-change事件的回调中对dayjs对象进行format\n            </p>\n            <b>format
